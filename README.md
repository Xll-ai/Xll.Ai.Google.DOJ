No inline scrollbars, but itâ€™s still readable, formatted, and works inside GitHub.

### ðŸ§ª Possible Workaround (with Gist or Web App)
If you *really* need scrollable boxes:
- Use a [GitHub Pages site](https://pages.github.com/) and build a styled page using HTML/CSS.
- Or, use a **GitHub Gist**, which lets you post long-form code or prompts (still scrollable within the browser).
- Or, link to a hosted version (Notion, Readme.io, or a doc site) with better formatting control.

Would you like me to reformat your content into a clean GitHub Markdown layout with collapsible sections? That would keep it readable without needing scrollbars.
